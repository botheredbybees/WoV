1	bearingToAnimals	Horizontal angle in degrees between the trackline and the line to the animal or group of animals when first sighted, even if a reliable species identification has not yet been made. The trackline is defined as the line of travel that the platform is actually doing, which may not necessarily be the proposed line that was in the original design. Assuming the platform is traveling forwards, the line of travel on the trackline, which is the front of the platform (e.g. bow of ship or front of plane) is at zero degrees bearing. During SEFSC vessel surveys, the observers scan the water from 10 degrees on the opposite side to 90 degrees and bearings are recorded from 0 to 90 on the left or right.
